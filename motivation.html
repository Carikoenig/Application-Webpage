			<h1>Why apply right now?</h1>
			<p>
			After having finished my Erasmus exchange in the Netherlands in February,
			I decided to remain in the country for another half year to really get the most out of the experience, learn the language more and enjoy the connections I just made the previous months.
			I could have just prolonged my exchange for another semester, but I didn't see the benefit of taking more theoretical courses at uni.
			After having studied many years already, I was really craving to finally surpass theory and was curious to get a pre-view of the job market and see what could possibly await me after finishing my degree.
			So, I decided to take a break from university life and take 6 months off to look for a job that would give me practical experiences and a clearer view about what job to look for after graduating.
			I am basically attempting to have a test-run of working life the year before actually graduating.

			<h1>Why apply at iscope?</h1>
			<p>
			When I browsed through the job openings that google kindly suggested to me, I got really excited to read about iscopes offer. Seeing a daily progress in my work and having a visual embodiement of what I work are key contributors
			that have kept me motivated during my programming projects in the past. Seeing a complete project come together from nothing to a finished application is a really intriguing and satisfying process to be involved in.
			It has come to my attention by now, that instead of a theoretical and more science based approach (that I mainly was exposed to in my computer science courses), a more practical approach and way of working might be suitable to me.
			I really want to seek and try out jobs that match this fact about my work motivation. Entering the field of web development seems like a befitting choice and prime candidate for these aspirations.
			To not get dissappointed in case it wouldn't be possible to start this job remotely before moving back to Osnabr√ºck to finish my degree, I phoned iscope on the spot to find out about the possibilities.
			I had a talk with two colleagues from the company that did indeed see chances for such a model and encouraged me to send in an application.
			Having received this feedback, I happily started working on my application knowing that at least locational circumstances wouldn't prevent my chances of employment.
			Putting my CV and motivational letter together in Word, I really felt that it was a rather boring way to apply and would not contribute much to showing my abilities.
			Anyways eager to revisit and improve on HTML/CSS basics, and really to just start already with the content that might become my job soon - the idea came to mind that my application in itself should obviously already be a website!
			I hope it shows more than that I can follow and copy from an online tutorial^^

			<h1>What job do I look for?</h1>
			<p> I set up some guidelines to narrow down which job openings seem like a useful option for me and my situation. Ideally, I want to find a job that satisfies the following criteria:
				<ul>
					<li>Try a job field that I would consider entering after graduating</li>
					<li>Programming should be involved in some shape or form, but avoid the rather low level ends of the spectrum, go for something more application oriented</li>
					<li>The possibility to enhance my skills and get practical experiences on the job and match expectations with reality</li>
					<li>An amount of work hours that surpass the usual 6-12 h student side job, ranging around +/- 20 h a week</li>
					<li>The possibility to keep the job with reduced hours after going back to uni, supporting me financially for the rest of my study time</li>
				</ul>
